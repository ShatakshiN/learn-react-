diff btw Default export and named export  

use default exports when you have only one component 
use named exports when there are multiple components 

default - can use any name at the time of import eg - 

function List(){}
export default List; 

at the time of import -  import Banana from "./list.tsx" - this will still give the functionality of List function 

named export  - need to write name in {} 

eg - function List2(){}
export function List2; 

at import - import {List2} from "./list2"
